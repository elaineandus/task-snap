![TaskSnap Snippet](tasksnap-snippet.png "TaskSnap Todo List Application")

TaskSnap is a to-do list application that I built using React Native framework and Expo from my subject 'Applications Development and Emerging Technologies' to help users stay organized and be productive. With its user-friendly interface, you can easily create, edit, check and delete your tasks to ensure that you never miss an important deadline. Whether you're a busy professional or a student, TaskSnap is the perfect tool to help you stay on top of your game.
